  "description": "A comprehensive 14-day ketogenic meal plan targeting approximately 75% fat, 20% protein, and 5% carbohydrates at a 2000-calorie base. Built around whole-food fat sources: avocados, olive oil, butter, nuts, fatty fish, and cheese. All scalable ingredients use precise gram measurements for proportional calorie adjustment. Based on evidence from systematic reviews (Bueno et al., 2013; Paoli et al., 2023) and current ketogenic nutrition guidelines.",
