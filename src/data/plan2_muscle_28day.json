  "description": "A practical 28-day muscle-building plan using just 16 base recipes in smart rotation. Designed for batch cooking: prep proteins and carbs on Sunday, assemble meals during the week. Targets 1.8g protein per kg bodyweight for an 80kg individual. Based on ISSN position stand recommendations for protein timing and distribution (Kerksick et al., 2017; Jäger et al., 2017). Post-workout meals emphasize fast-digesting protein + carbohydrates within 30 minutes of training.",
